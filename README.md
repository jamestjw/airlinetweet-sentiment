# airlinetweet-sentiment
We predict the sentiment of airline related tweets using a deep learning model. Using a dataset downloaded from Kaggle, we first finetune a pretrained language model (using AWD-LSTM) on the corpus of the dataset, we then train a classification model to predict either 'positive', 'negative' or 'neutral'.
